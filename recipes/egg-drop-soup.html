        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>chicken stock</li>
            <li>sesame oil</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>sugar</li>
            <li>white pepper</li>
            <li>turmeric</li>
            <li>cornstarch</li>
            <li>eggs</li>
            <li>scallion</li>
            <li>MSG</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Simmer the chicken stock in a medium soup pot and then add sesame oil, salt, sugar, white pepper, and optional turmeric or yellow food coloring for a rich, restaurant-style yellow color in the soup.</li>
            <li>Afterward, incorporate the cornstarch. Start by combining a small quantity of water with the cornstarch, ensuring thorough mixing as cornstarch tends to settle rapidly. As you gradually pour in this slurry, continue stirring the soup to prevent any starch clumps from forming. Adjust the amount of starch to achieve your desired soup thickness; alternatively, add it in small increments, allowing the soup to simmer briefly before checking and adjusting the consistency to your preference.</li>
            <li>Next, incorporate the egg. In this recipe, the egg should be lightly beaten, resulting in an appealing blend of white and yellow egg swirls within the soup. The size of the resulting egg patterns, whether they resemble large "egg flowers" or smaller swirly bits, is influenced by the speed at which you stir the soup during the egg addition. To achieve your desired effect, employ a ladle to gently stir the soup in a circular motion, gradually drizzling in the beaten egg until it's fully integrated.</li>
            <li>Scoop the soup into bowls, garnish with scallions, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
